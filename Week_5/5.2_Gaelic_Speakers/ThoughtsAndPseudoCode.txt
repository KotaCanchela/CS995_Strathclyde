Relative speakers => read total number of people.
We need to read "All people" data.

Data contain areas:
  - Wards
  - Scotland

We have total number of people for all age groups.
  - We need to use the "Total", rather than the age dependant data.

The categories in the file are:
  x "Understands but does not speak, read or write Gaelic"
  o "Speaks, reads and writes Gaelic"
  o Speaks but does not read or write Gaelic
  o Speaks and reads but does not write Gaelic
  x Reads but does not speak or write Gaelic
  x Other combination of skills in Gaelic
  x No skills in Gaelic

Areas = {}
Areas["area"] = PopulationByAge
PopulationByAge = {}
PopulationByAge["age"] = SkillCategory
SkillCategory = {}
SkillCategory["skill"] = int # Number of people.

LOOP over areas:
  IF area == "Scotland":
    continue

  IF age != Total:
    continue

  sum = 0
  FOR category in speakingCatogries:
    sum += numberOfPeople

  absoluteSpeakers[area] = sum
  relativeSpeakers[area] = sum / totalPeople
